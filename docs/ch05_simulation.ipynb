    "## Action and Observation Spaces\n",
    "Certain types of action and observation spaces may be required by tests. For example, `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` is a capability that requires a model to operate on discrete observation spaces. A test that has `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` in its `required_capabilities` variable may do checks specific to a discrete observation space. We would like to note two items here\n",
    "1. `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` defines and at the same time provides a default implementation of discrete observation interface using `gym.spaces.Discrete`. However, this can be changed by creating a subclass of `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` and providing your own discrete observation space implementations.\n",
    "2. Currently, there are no example tests that require a certain type of action or observation space. Hence, we don't provide any example code here."
