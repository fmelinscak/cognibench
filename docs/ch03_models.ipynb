For example, `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` is a capability that requires a model to operate on discrete observation spaces. A test that has `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` in its `required_capabilities` variable may do checks specific to a discrete observation space. We would like to note two items here\n",

However, this can be changed by creating a subclass of `ldmunit.capabilities.DiscreteObservation` and providing your own discrete observation space implementations.\n",

This capability is implemented in `ldmunit.capabilities.LogProbModel`. This class states this requirement in the documentation of `predict` method. However, since there is no easy way to do a check in python at class initialization time whether an instance returns a log probability distribution as a result of `predict` method, this is not strictly enforced. The assumption is that if the programmer explicitly subclasses `ldmunit.capabilities.LogProbModel`, the class satisfies the requirement."
