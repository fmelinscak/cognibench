For example, `InteractiveTest` requires the models to implement the requirements specified by `ldmunit.capabilities.Interactive` capability. In addition to test classes, the score class used for testing can also require capabilities. If you want to use `ldmunit.scores.AICScore`, then the model should also have `ldmunit.capabilities.PredictsLogpdf` and `ldmunit.capabilities.ReturnsNumParams` capabilities. We can see these requirements as follows:"

Although this is not directly required for interacting with environments, it allows a very straightforward model implementation. In `ldmunit`, this functionality is in `ldmunit.models.policy_model.PolicyModel` class."
