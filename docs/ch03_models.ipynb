For example, `InteractiveTest` requires the models to implement the requirements specified by `cognibench.capabilities.Interactive` capability. In addition to test classes, the score class used for testing can also require capabilities. If you want to use `cognibench.scores.AICScore`, then the model should also have `cognibench.capabilities.PredictsLogpdf` and `cognibench.capabilities.ReturnsNumParams` capabilities. We can see these requirements as follows:"
