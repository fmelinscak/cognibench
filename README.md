# LDMUnit
LDMUnit is a framework for test and validation of learning and decision making models.
It is built mainly on top of [sciunit](https://github.com/scidash/sciunit) and [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) libraries.
It uses the same test-model-capability categorization first implemented in sciunit to run test suites
consisting of several tests on a set of models.
