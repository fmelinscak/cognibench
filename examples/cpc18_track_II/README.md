# Description
In this example we test three hypothetical submissions made to CPC18 track II.  We assume that every participant
submitted a folder containing their models and the main script provided by the CPC committee.

Two of the models are implemented in R. You can see the model definitions required to use these models in
`model_defs.py` file.

# Running
```bash
python test_cpc_contestants.py
```

# Acknowledgements
Model implementations and data in this folder are obtained from CPC18 official website:
