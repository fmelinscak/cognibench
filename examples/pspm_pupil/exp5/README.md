# Experiment 5
Standard pre-processing pipeline (excluding n data points left and right of missing epochs as per previous import
function, and taking the best eye) vs. new pre-processing pipeline.

## Configuration Variables
1. `blink_saccade_edge_discard_factor`
  - Current values: `[0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02]`
2. TODO: we need reasonable preprocessing configurations for the new function
