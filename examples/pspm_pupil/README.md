# PsPM Pupil Benchmarking
This folder contains the benchmarking codes for seven different experiments that measure the retrodictive validity
of various psychophysiological models. In each experiment, a series of models that are created by combining certain
configuration parameters are tested against seven different pupil datasets. The datasets, along with their links, are
given below:
