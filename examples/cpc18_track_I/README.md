# Description
In this example we test three hypothetical submissions made to CPC18 track I. All three
models are slight variations of the baseline BEASTsd model provided by CPC18 committee.
We assume that every participant submitted a folder containing their models and the main
script provided by the CPC committee.

# Running
Simply type
```bash
python test_cpc_contestants.py
```

# Acknowledgements
Codes and data in this folder are obtained from CPC18 official website: `https://cpc-18.com/baseline-models-and-source-code`
