# Examples
In this folder we provide various examples of how `ldmunit` can be used. One sentence descriptions of each of the
directories are provided below. For more detailed explanations and the actual code, please refer to the specific folder.

1. `assoc_learning_simulated`: A full-fledged testing example of multi-subject associative learning models on simulated
data using interactive tests and various scores.
2. `decision_making_simulated`: A full-fledged testing example of multi-subject decision making models on simulated data
using interactive tests and various scores.
3. `model_recovery`: Example usecase of model recovery functionality using both single-subject and multi-subject models.
4. `param_recovery`: Example usecase of parameter recovery functionality using single-subject models.
5. `data_simulation`: Example usecase of data simulation functionality using both single-subject and multi-subject
models.
6. `hbayesdm`: Testing example of models implemented in other frameworks (hBayesDM in this case) which only require
simple wrapper model definitions to use with `ldmunit`.
7. `cpc18_track_I`: Testing example of baseline models from Choice Prediction Competition '18 Track I implemented in
Python, Octave and R languages.
8. `cpc18_track_II`: Testing example of baseline models from Choice Prediction Competition '18 Track II implemented in
Python and R languages.
